# DS-2002-Final

This is my final for DS 2002. Before looking at the code I'd like to mention that the second half of the semester has been extremly hard for me and many students at UVA. This final project is unfortunately not up to my standards due to the circumstances and the immense grief surrounding me and the community at UVA. Additionally, I had trouble connecting to all the different systems and I hope my technical problems do not detract from the effort I put in for my attempt at this final. All I ask for is leniency and compassion when grading this assignment, have a great rest of the semester!
